# Requirements

None, not even Aurora. If you get error messages related to missing a .NET Core runtime or nothing happens if you start the exe, try [downloading and installing this](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.3-windows-x86-installer). 

# Usage

Download the latest release and extract to a directory. Run the .exe. If the directory doesn't contain a copy of Aurora the latest version will be downloaded automatically. Mods in the online registry can be viewed, installed, upgraded, and configured on the 'Manage Mods' tab. 

# Features

- Automatically updates Aurora and itself
- Browse mods on the Aurora Registry by type, version, and whether or not they've been approved by the developer
- Validates mod structure and compatibility with your version of Aurora
- Supports running Aurora with custom exe launchers, database modifications, and any launching number of utilities*
- Supports configuring many mods
- Adds optional in-game music

*Using mods carries with it the risk of unintended behavior - we ask that you not submit bug reports to the developer when using mods outside of the 'Approved' category and make this clear in the UI.

# Mod Registry

https://github.com/Aurora-Modders/AuroraRegistry is the primary Aurora mod registry and will soon contain instructions for setting up additional registries alongside examples. AuroraLoader is designed to work with multiple registries as defined in https://github.com/Aurora-Modders/AuroraLoader/blob/master/AuroraLoader/mirrors.ini. Our goal is to allow members of the Aurora community to autonomously release and update mods that will show up in Aurora Loader while according with the developer's wishes and having a hell of a lot of fun.
